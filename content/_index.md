My name is Alexandra Hartman. I am a Professor of Political Science and 
Public Policy at **University College London (UCL)** and a Co-Director of the **[UCL Policy Lab](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/policy-lab/)**. 

I am a faculty affiliate of the **[Immigration Policy Lab](https://immigrationlab.org)** and **[EGAP](https://egap.org)**.

I study the relationship between marginalized social groups and the state. Much of my work
focuses on property rights inequality, the consequences of displacement and surviving sexual violence.  I use RCTs, micro-level data, and in-depth field research to understand when and how empowerment is successful. I also write about research ethics. 

I am thankful for the support of The National Science Foundation, The Norwegian Refugee Council, EGAP, ELRHA, Landesa, DfID, UNHCR, USAID, FID, JPAL, IPA, The International Growth Centre, UCL, and Yale University. My work has been published or is forthcoming in *PNAS*, *International Organization*, *The Journal of Conflict Resolution*, *The Journal of Politics*, *The British 
Journal of Political Science*, *The Journal of Peace Research*, and *The 
American Political Science Review*.
