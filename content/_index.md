My name is Alexandra Hartman. I am a Professor of Political Science and Public Policy at **[University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/social-historical-sciences/political-science)** and a Co-Director of the **[UCL Policy Lab](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/policy-lab/)**. 

I am a faculty affiliate of the **[Immigration Policy Lab](https://immigrationlab.org)** and **[EGAP](https://egap.org)**.

I use RCTs, micro-level data, and in-depth field research to study the relationship between marginalised social groups and the state. 

Much of my work focuses on displacement, property rights inequality and surviving sexual violence. I also write about research ethics.  I conduct a lot of research in conflict and post-conflict states, but I also work on displacement and sexual violence in Europe and the UK.

I am thankful to so many people for participating in my research. I am grateful for the support of The National Science Foundation, The Norwegian Refugee Council, EGAP, ELRHA, Landesa, DfID, UNHCR, USAID, FID, J-PAL, IPA, The International Growth Centre, UCL, and Yale University. 

My work has been published or is forthcoming in *PNAS*, *International Organization*, *The Journal of Conflict Resolution*, *The Journal of Politics*, *The British 
Journal of Political Science*, *The Journal of Peace Research*, and *The 
American Political Science Review*.
